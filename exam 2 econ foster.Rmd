## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#stat question 


# a) For a Normal Distribution that has mean 1 and standard deviation 6.5, what is the area to the left of 1.65?
pnorm(1.65, mean = 1, sd = 6.5)
#0.5398278  answer

#b) For a Normal Distribution that has mean 8 and standard deviation 2.7, what is the area in both tails farther from the mean than 13.67?

#-5.67
pnorm(-5.67, mean = 8, sd = 2.7)
pnorm(21.67, mean = 8, sd = 2.7)
 0.9999998-2.06395e-07
# 0.9999996 answer
 

#c)For a Normal Distribution that has mean -11 and standard deviation 4, what is the area in both tails farther from the mean than -5.4?

pnorm(-16.4, mean = -11, sd = 4)
pnorm(-5.6, mean = -11, sd = 4)
0.911492-0.08850799
# 0.822984 answer

#d)For a Normal Distribution that has mean 14 and standard deviation 7.4 what two values leave probability 0.158 in both tails?
qnorm(0.156, mean = 14, sd = 7.4, lower.tail = TRUE)
qnorm(0.156, mean = 14, sd = 7.4, lower.tail = FALSE)
#[ 6.518346, 21.48165] answer

#e)A regression coefficient is estimated to be equal to 6.56 with standard error 4.1; there are 24 degrees of freedom. What is the p-value (from the t-statistic) against the null hypothesis of zero?

6.56/4.1
pt(1.6, 24)
0.9386593*2
#1.877319 answer

#f)A regression coefficient is estimated to be equal to -0.24 with standard error 0.4; there are 4 degrees of freedom. What is the p-value (from the t-statistic) against the null hypothesis of zero?
-0.24/0.4
pt(-0.6,4)
0.2904206*2

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
